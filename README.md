on the theme of "You are the villain"

You play a mining giant who just want to earn a living. To earn this living, you send out probes around the globe (sprinkle them around - but watch it, they cost a bit) which detect the presence of valuable minerals. They will grow in size when they pass a vein. 

You now know where you should blow up the earth - don't be stingy with the explosives (they're not so expensive). You'll need a fair bit to get to the core. With luck, you'll to uncover the red goodness. 

Once you have unearthed some treasure, deploy a mine (careful, it's a bit pricy all this digging) to retrieve the goods and earn your coin while tilling the earth bare!
